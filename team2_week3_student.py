"""ELP Week 3 — Team 2 Student Starter
Agentic Research Team: Supervisor + Specialist Agents + Parallelism

Week 2 already gave you:
    Question -> Supervisor -> first assignment -> Tavily -> Response

Week 3 goal:
    Question -> Supervisor -> Specialist Agents in Parallel -> Specialist Results

Your job is to complete the NEW Week 3 TODOs only.

Run:
    python -m pip install -r requirements_team2.txt
    streamlit run team2_week3_student.py
